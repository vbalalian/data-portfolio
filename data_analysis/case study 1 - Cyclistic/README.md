<b>"About the company</b>
<br><br>
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.
<br><br>
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
<br><br>
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will
be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, they believe there is a
very good chance to convert casual riders into members. They note that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic
program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
<br><br>
The marketing director has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The director and her team are
interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends."
