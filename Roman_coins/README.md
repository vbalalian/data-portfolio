# Python-built webscraper and parser
Built as a Jupyter notebook using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas, for the purpose of constructing a limited dataset of ancient Roman coins. 

## For learning purposes...
I wanted to build a webscraper from scratch. Since my focus was on the webscraping itself rather than the data in question, I chose a less analysis-friendly subject in favor of one that has not only some personal interest to me, but which seemed to present just the right challenges to help me grow in that area.

...is a simple website which, by its own description, was "created as a reference and attribution resource in the field of ancient numismatics." The website is simple html, and the data we're extracting is conveniently organized into a subset of similarly simple html pages for each "ruler," or subject on the face of each coin.

The data produced is far from perfect, and hardly ripe for analysis; but the webscraper itself features a number of interesting elements.
